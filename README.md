## Purpose

shadyssh simplifies the process of setting up a secure remote shell via OpenSSH on Windows. It is useful for developers, system administrators, and testers who need quick SSH access to a Windows machine.

## What shadyssh.bat Does

1. Requests Administrator privileges.
2. Enables the default Windows `Administrator` account.
3. Sets a password for the Administrator account (`test` by default).

## Usage
Just put it in thumbdrive then sneak and plugin into system run it and leave then you have access to the system. No need to drop it to the  victims system run it in when the file is inside your thumbdrive. ðŸ¤£ just kidding.... 

I don't encourage to use it such way. use it leaglly with permision and run the `stopshadyssh.bat` after testing to revert all settings back to normal.

### Setup

Run `shadyssh.bat`
